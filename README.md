# FitLog - Personal Health & Fitness Tracker 🏋️‍♂️

> A personal health and fitness tracking web application built from scratch, focusing on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with Java and a modern, interactive frontend using React.

This project was developed as a full-stack application to track daily workouts, monitor progress, and visualize fitness data over time.

## 📚 Project Goals & What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to:
* Apply and solidify core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a real-world Java application.
* Understand the fundamentals of building a full-stack application from the ground up, without relying on frameworks like Spring Boot.
* Learn how a Java backend communicates with a modern React frontend via a RESTful API.
* Implement full CRUD functionality and handle user authentication with sessions.
* Gain experience in data visualization by integrating a charting library with data fetched from a backend API.
